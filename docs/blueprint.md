## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F5FF). The hue is close to that of the primary, but almost fully desaturated for calm and readability in a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Violet (#7B42FF) which provides visual interest through a higher degree of saturation and shift toward the purple end of the spectrum.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for a clean and modern look.
- Use a set of minimal, consistent icons for skills and categories.
- Employ a grid-based layout to maintain organization and readability.
- Implement subtle transition effects on hover interactions.
